## hi, i'm benjamin

I'm an engineer and researcher focused on building AI that's aligned with human values. I am also working on research related to transportation policy and government-citizen interactions as a Fellow at NYU's [Marron Institute](https://marroninstitute.nyu.edu/). I'm currently in London working on technical AI safety as part of [LASR Labs](https://www.lasrlabs.org/).

- ðŸŒ± Currently working on: LLM evals
- ðŸ’» Recent project: an [LLM tokenizer](https://github.com/benarnav/bytephase) in Python with C extensions
- ðŸš¦ Read my latest piece: [Why Does the NYPD Ignore So Many Parking Complaints?](https://www.vitalcitynyc.org/articles/illegal-parking-and-failed-governance-ai-study-of-nypd-enforcement), which was based on this [research](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4974275)

## hi, i'm benjamin

I'm an engineer and researcher focused on building AI that's aligned with human values. I also work on research related to transportation policy and government-citizen interactions as a Fellow at NYU's [Marron Institute](https://marroninstitute.nyu.edu/). I'm currently in London working on technical AI safety research as part of the [ML Alignment & Theory Scholars (MATS) Program](https://www.matsprogram.org)
